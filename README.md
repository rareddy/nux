# Nux
This a forked repository of http://dst.lbl.gov/ACSSoftware/nux library. The reasoon it was forked is to able to deploy this library into Maven Central. Currently there does not seem to be any active development on this project, however this will also serve as the forked copy for Teiid project purposes if any issues are raised.

The original ANT based build is modified to Maven builld, and maven group name used is "org.teiid", rest everything should map 1.6 version from above link.
